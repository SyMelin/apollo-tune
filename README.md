# Exercise Project - apollo-tune

The purpose of this project is to learn MaterialUI and qraphQL while practising and exercising my React skills.

The project itself comes from `the React Bootcamp` promoted by [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-learn-react-in-2023/).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

react and react-dom were downgraded to version ^17.0.2 in order to avoid package conflicts with materialUI.

Hasura is used to provide the backend service linked to a Neon database.

Keywords: react, graphQL, Apollo, Hasura, MaterialUI, music app.
